# Prints a short story about a bird
print(Welcome to my short story, I hope you enjoy.)
print(In a beautiful park, a young bird named Pip preferred singing from his branch to searching for breakfast.)
print(One morning, he watched a wise robin snag a worm, and curiosity sparked in him.)
print(The next day, Pip rose with the sun and discovered a feast of worms waiting for early risers.)
print(From then on, he learned that the early bird truly catches the best rewards.)
